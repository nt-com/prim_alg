### Prim's Algorithm in C++

Finds a minimal spanning tree in a connected, undirected and weighted graph. Unconnected graphs are not supported by this version.
The graph parameters can be modified in graph_cfg.h.
The minimal spanning tree and the total cost of the tree are displayed and Prim's Algorithm is applied to a randomly generated graph.

Usage: cd src/ && make
